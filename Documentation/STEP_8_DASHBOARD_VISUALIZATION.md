### 2. New Translation Keys

Added comprehensive translation support for all new UI elements:

#### English ([en.json](file:///X:/Digital Raitha/src/locales/en.json))
- Added 40+ new translation keys for predictions tab
- Included translations for all new UI elements

#### Hindi ([hi.json](file:///X:/Digital Raitha/src/locales/hi.json))
- Added Hindi translations for all new UI elements
- Maintained consistency with existing translation structure

### 3. API Integration

Enhanced the [agroIntelService.js](file:///X:/Digital Raitha/src/services/agroIntelService.js) with:

#### Real-Time Predictions Method
```javascript
async fetchRealTimePredictions(farmerData) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/predict/realtime', farmerData);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to mock data if API fails
    return mockData;
  }
}
```

### 4. UI Components

#### Recommended Crops Visualization 🌾
- Visual cards displaying best crop recommendations
- Icons and color coding for different crop types
- Supporting information for each recommendation

#### Predicted Yield Charts 📊
- Numerical yield predictions with units
- Confidence indicators showing model reliability
- Revenue estimates based on current market prices
- Yield potential classification (High/Medium/Low)

#### ROI and Cost-Benefit Analysis 💰
- Return on Investment (ROI) metrics
- Detailed cost breakdown (seeds, fertilizers, labor)
- Investment vs. income comparison
- Payback period calculation

#### Local Language Translation 🗣️
- Integrated with existing i18n framework
- Added new translation keys for all elements
- Maintained consistency with existing language support

#### Map Layout Integration 🗺️
- Enhanced existing Google Maps integration
- Added farm boundary visualization
- Included GPS coordinates display
- Added verification status indicators
